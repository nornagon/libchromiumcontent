# This file lists all of the disabled tests
# It is used by the run_tests script to determine the tests to be excluded
# Here's an example of the file contents format:
#
# test_name:
#   - exclude_test_filter
#
# The `test_name` is the test target that's built (same as the test executable name)
# The `exclude_test_filter` is the gtest filter pattern that should be applied for
# exclusion. All tests matching this pattern will be excluded.
